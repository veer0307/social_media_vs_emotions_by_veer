The notebook focuses on analyzing the impact of social media usage on emotional well-being. It involves data loading, preprocessing, and applying machine learning techniques to derive insights. The project incorporates a survey with over 50 questions, aimed at collecting data on social media habits and emotional health. Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are utilized for data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.
The primary objective is to uncover patterns and correlations between social media activity and mental health outcomes, contributing to a deeper understanding of how digital interactions influence well-being.
The results suggest a significant correlation between high social media usage and increased levels of anxiety and depression. This indicates that excessive engagement with social media platforms may have a detrimental effect on emotional well-being, leading to negative emotions such as anxiety, stress, and sadness.
